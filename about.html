           <h2>About the Visualization</h2>
             <p>The project follows the Martini Glass narrative visualization structure. The Overview page represents the base of the visualization structure.
				The user is being exposed to the author driven content.Other three pages are mix of both user driven content as well reader driven content as it highlights some of the authors thought and also provides highlighting and tooltip which allow users to draw their own conclusions.
				</p>
                <p>This project has been developed using D3 libraries, HTML, CSS and SVG.</p>
                <h3>User Interface Events</h3>
                <p>The menu items along with the prev and next button in the navigation bar of this page enable the User Interface events. 
				User interacts by clicking on the button or menu items to navigate to various part of this story.
				The mouse hover is another user interface event. The hover event allows proper positioning of the tooltip.
				As mouse moves from one bar to another, changes in X and Y position causes opacity to revert back to its original state in the previous selection and change in the new selection.
                </p>
                <h3>Annotations</h3>
                  <p>Annotations are provided in appropriate places in each chart, which is highlighted in different color 
				  and a tooltip, when mouse is hovered over the bars and maps.</p>
                <h3>Triggers</h3>
                <p>The mouse click acts as a trigger event for navigation.
                  The mouse hover (mouseover) event is a trigger for the tooltip in the charts and map.
                </p>
                <h3>Parameters</h3>
